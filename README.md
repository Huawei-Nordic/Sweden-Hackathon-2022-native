# Sweden-Hackathon-2022-native

### I'm in!

1. fork/clone this project
2. start coding!



### What just happened? Am I really ready to go?

Yes!! The starter project is a native Android skeleton app that:

- has the main HMS Kits added as dependencies 
- has all relevant permissions added to the Android manifest
- connects to a shared account on [App Gallery](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/mobileservices/appgallery/) which is needed by the majority of the HMS Kits
- when started, does a self test to check if everything is properly configured

### But I don't have a Huawei HMS test device ...

There are solutions.

1. If you're participating on-site, ask for a test device at the Huawei booth
2. Download and temporary install HMS Core on your own Android device from [here](https://appgallery.cloud.huawei.com/appdl/C10132067)
3. [Cloud Debugging](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/Tools-Guides/CloudDebugging-introduction) : this requires you to actually own/create a Huawei Developer account, but once that's done, you can just download the [HMS Toolkit Android Studio plugin](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/Tools-Guides/installation-0000001050145206) and access physical devices in the cloud
